# IonThruster
Matlab Simulator of an Ion Thruster

### Equations
F = qE
a = qE/m
V = a*(delta h)

### Notes
RocketExample is just a file I downloaded from the internet that can be used as an example related to rocket thrust and other parameters, as well as how to plot multiple things at once in Matlab.  Do not use this for the actual 325 project.
